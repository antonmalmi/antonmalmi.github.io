<p align="justify"> I am currently working on a project called <b>"The Articulatory Properties of Children's Acquisition of Estonian Palatalization"</b> in collaboration with Claire Nance from Lancaster University, UK. I will be updating this page with the relevant info about the project in the future. If you are very eager to find out more about it, please write me an email. I have also set up an <p><a href="https://osf.io/vs846/">OSF page</a></p> for the data. </p>

<p align="justify"> We have currently submitted a conference paper to Fonetik 2025 (May 21-23, Växjö, Sweden) and will be giving talks at The 46th International Child Phonology Conference (May 28-20, ICPC 2025, Budapest, Hungary), University College London (June 5, London, UK) and MEDAL conference (October 9-10, Tartu, Estonia).  </p>
