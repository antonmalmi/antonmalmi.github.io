<p align="justify"> Teretulemast! Welcome! </p>
<p align="justify"> I am currently leading a project called <b>"The Articulatory Properties of Children's Acquisition of Estonian Palatalisation"</b> in collaboration with Claire Nance from Lancaster University, UK. I will be updating this page with relevant information about the project in the future. If you are very eager to find out more about it, please write me an email. I have also set up an <a href="https://osf.io/vs846/">OSF page</a> for the data. </p>

<p align="justify"> Regarding this project we have submitted a conference paper to <b>Fonetik 2025</b> (May 21-23, Växjö, Sweden) and will be giving talks at <b>The 46th International Child Phonology Conference</b> (May 28-20, 2025, Budapest, Hungary), <b>University College London</b> (June 5, London, UK) and <b>MEDAL conference</b> (October 9-10, Tartu, Estonia).  </p>
