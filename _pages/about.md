<p align="justify"> I am currently working on a project called <b>"The Articulatory Properties of Children's Acquisition of Estonian Palatalization"</b> in collaboration with Claire Nance from Lancaster University, UK. I will be updating this page with the relevant info about the project in the future. If you are very eager to find out more about it, please write me an email. </p>
