## Project overview
<div style="text-align: justify;">
<p>LexEst is a short 90-item and freely accessible vocabulary test designed for Estonian L2 speakers. Modelled after the original Lexical Test for Advanced Learners of English (LexTale; Lemhöfer & Broersma, 2012), LexEst has been adapted to assess vocabulary size across varying proficiency levels, similar to other recent LexTale variants (e.g., Izura et al., 2014; Amenta et al., 2020; Salmela et al., 2021). Our findings demonstrate that LexEst provides an objective measure of L2 learners’ Estonian vocabulary, aligning well with subjective language proficiency indicators, such as self-assessed skills. Higher LexEst scores are associated with more advanced CEFR-level language courses, earlier age of learning Estonian, greater daily use of the language, and higher perceived importance of learning Estonian.</p>
